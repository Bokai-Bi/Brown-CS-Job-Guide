# This guide exists to make recruiting easier aka less time-consuming and stressful. Recruiting should only be a small portion of your life. Please spend time on friends, clubs, and cool projects.

All your friends suddenly started talking about nonsensical terms and giving you anxiety? Feeling FOMO over not knowing what to prepare or what opportunities are available? Inspired by [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/), this document will try to condense everything you need to know about the CS internship/job process while in BrownCS. The goal is to **maximize job prospects** while **minimizing stress** so you can spend you time on [cooler things](#shameless-personal-interest-plugs) :)

# Motivation
I was chatting with a friend in Sunlab and realized there's no resource in Brown to help learning about the CS recruiting process. Recruiting is complicated and figuring everything out yourself take a lot of energy and creates anxiety. In the meantime, seniors with recruiting knowledge typically graduate without an opportunity to pass it down. 

Personally, I think I have a pretty broad experience in recruiting & BrownCS - I've gotten offers from well-funded startups, quant firms, and tech companies of all sizes. In the past, I interned at Stripe and JPMorgan Chase, did systems research as an UTRA, TAed multiple classes, and also worked as a [SPOC](https://cs.brown.edu/people/staff/spoc/). At the same time, I was also able to spend a lot of time doing [things I like](#shameless-personal-interest-plugs) outside of recruiting. I hope this guide will help making sure that recruiting doesn't eat up your life.

# Timeline
- Applications for summer SWE internships/jobs start opening up on **Early May the year before**. For example, for Summer 2027 internships, you should start applying **May 2026**. **YOU SHOULD APPLY ASAP WHEN ANY APP OPENS!!** This is no longer college applications - most listings are rolling and first-come-first-serve. Apply within the first day or two gives you the best chances
- Brown internal opportunities:
  - [UTRA](https://utra.brown.edu/students#application-process) is a program where you apply to do research projects with faculty. This generally is a very nice starting point for your resume.
    - Applications for Spring semester UTRA is generally due late Sept/early Oct.
    - Applications for Summer semester UTRA is generally due late Jan/early Feb.
    - Applications for Fall semester UTRA is generally due early/mid May.
  - Outside of UTRA, don't be afraid to just approach professors and ask if they have research opportunities available! This is especially helpful if they know you from class.
  - BrownCS has a sizable undergraudate TA program that's also a nice starting point for resume. This is traditionally pretty competitive especially for intro classes, though you should apply anyways.
    - [Timeline](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/ta/hiring/). UTA applications generally open ~early Oct and you should get an email from the CS Department containing links.

# Principles
This section covers best practices to be following during job apps.
- Apply ASAP to any listing. Applications are generally rolling.
- Apply a LOT (ideally to all new listings) until your resume is good enough to not need it. The market is competitive, and people generally send out hundreds of applications.
  - For reference, my freshman summer I sent ~300 applications with 3 interviews. Sophomore summer I sent ~300 applications with 8 interviews.
- Allocate dedicated daily time over the Summer and early Fall for job apps. Apply quickly and forget - don't let it bleed all over your life.
- Check your emails frequently. Recruiters will be reaching out there.

# Resources
Every tool listed here is basically essential for the process.
- [Simplify](https://simplify.jobs/) is a browser extension that automatically fills job applications for you. Very extremely helpful for mass applying and almost universally used.
- [Jake's Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) is a LaTeX resume template that is used by almost everyone in CS. This is results-proven to be ATS (Applicant Tracking System, aka auto resume screener) friendly and LaTeX is a lot easier to manage in the long run than CareerLab/Center for Career Exploration's template, even if you have no experience in LaTeX at the moment.
- [Pitt CSC & Simplify Job Board](https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2026-Internships) is the biggest centralized CS internship job board (there's a new grad version as well). It is updated multiple times a day during application season to show the newest openings. You should be checking this daily. There are also alternative boards that you can optionally cross-reference like the [Vansh & Ouckah Board](https://github.com/vanshb03/Summer2026-Internships).

# Resume Tips
- Include interesting numbers. How many users/requests/data entries does your work handle? How many different APIs/services does it interact with? Are there financial figures you can cite?
  - Avoid unsubstantiated/confusing numbers like "improved developer speed by 300%". Be careful with percentages.
- Include interesting keywords. Did you use a cool cloud technology? Kernel framework? Sophisticated data structure? Let people know.
- Bold keywords to make your resume easier to read
- Find some resume you like and dissect what seems impressive about it. Resume-writing involves a lot of thinking!

# Interview Tips
- Interview is NOT a test. Have a fun conversation with your interviewer! Sometimes I like to talk about video games or anime.
- Get plenty of sleep, don't do any LC the day of your interview (or even the day before). Get some sugar and caffine and relax. Keep your nerves no matter what.
- Leetcode prep wise I recommend doing [Blind 75/Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice) questions list.
  - Do questions by difficulty and interleave categories
  - Think about the solution and give up if you can't find something within 30 minutes. You learn MUCH more from reading and understanding a good answer than breaking your head on some silly brain teaser.
  - I recommend Neetcode for solution/explaination videos
- Get a friend to mock interview you helps.

# FAQ
- Recruiting sucks, this is causing a lot of anxiety and stress, I hate how much people do this :(
  - **ME TOO AHHHHHHH**. My least favorite thing about BrownCS is how easy it is to be jumped by recruiting conversations when I'm having fun with friends. It's pretty instinctual to want to procrastinate on thinking about it, but in my experience it just keeps on weighing on me and make me avoid it more. Ultimately, I think there are two ways of getting out of this without letting jobs consume your life. Either you decide to fully walk your own path, or you speedrun recruiting so you have more free time. I think both are really valid, and the former is especially underrated within the department. They're also not mutually exclusive. It's hard to not doubt yourself when you're surrounded in a CS environment, but I think you won't regret doing something you truly want.
- I've sent out hundreds of applications and have barely gotten any OAs let alone interviews.
  - This is unfortunately normal and expected. You should just keep applying and think about it less. If you're worried about your resume you're always welcome to DMed on Discord at @KoishiHat and I can try to help.
- How much do cover letters matter?
  - I generally keep a pre-written cover letter that I can tweak for different companies - generally the point of a cover letter should be to relate your skills/experiences to the job.
- Do I tailor my resume to the job?
  - Yes you should. Some keyword order switch/substitutions should be enough though.
- Do referrals matter? How do I decide between applying early vs. waiting for a referral?
  - If the company is above 500 people it matters significantly less. Don't worry too much about it, though do get them if you could.
  - Some companies allow retroactively applying referrals after application.
  - I still don't know if it's worth it to wait lol, exercise your own judgment, though if you have specific companies in mind you should reach out before apps open.
- How many applications is enough for freshman/sophomore/junior/senior year?
  - Apply until you're numb to it, and then congrats! You can now apply some more!
- I hear of other people are getting interviews and offers left and right, I have nothing :(
  - A surprising majority of people have been there at some point. The way I like to think about it is that if you worry over every person doing better than you at something you'd die before you finish worrying. Your life is yours alone, so don't think too much about others.
- Can you give me cool video game recommendations?
  - PLZPLZPLZ I want to talk to ppl about games especially Touhou!! I'm also down to talk about anime!! Message me on Discord @KoishiHat

# Glossary

# Classes
This section retrospectively covers a list of classes I took. Note I'm a systems person so coverage isn't complete. 

## This list is highly-subjective low-confidence advice and everyone's probably different, only consult this when you're undecided. **You should prioritize taking classes interesting to you! I took all these classes because I found them interesting, and I'm sure classes you find interesting are helpful to recruiting as well**

Recruiting Utility | Description
--- | ---
★★★★ | Recommended to everyone. Take ASAP when possible.
★★★ | Situationally amazing. Strongly recommended unless impossible / not the area you want to work in.
★★ | Can be strong if you make a particularly good project or continue deep into the field through research/subsequent classes.
★ | Specialized classes. These are required if you want to do their respective niche fields, but otherwise won't help much.

Course number | Time-consumption/week | Recruiting Utility | Notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
CSCI 0300 Fundamentals of Computer Systems | 4 hrs | ★★★★ | 300 is a key prereq for all systems classes and systems is very employable. Good knowledge to have even if you don't want to do systems.
CSCI 1670/90 Operating Systems (with lab) | (10?) hrs | ★★★ | Class is currently under redesign. Concepts are essential if you want to do systems. 
CSCI 2680 Computer Networks and the Internet | 8 hrs | ★★★ | This is a paper-reading research seminar. Gives you extremely strong resume project & interview conversation topics.
CSCI 2690 Data Center and Cloud Operating Systems | 10 hrs | ★★★ | Same as above, but for OS rather than networks.
CSCI 1470 Deep Learning | 10 hrs | ★★★ | Cool content but difficult class. Good general knowledge even if you don't do AI. Good project opportunity.
CSCI 1675 High-Performance Computer Networks | 12 hrs | ★★★ | Impressive deep exploration class. Not recommended to general public though.
CSCI 1260 Compilers and Program Analysis | 3 hrs | ★★ | Easy class and interesting content, it's pretty niche but good general knowledge to have.
CSCI 1680 Computer Networks | 4 hrs | ★★ | Networks is helpful if you need a cool personal project. It's also pretty employable in systems & quant dev.
CSCI 1010 Theory of Computation | 6 hrs | ★★ | Difficult math class, good interview conversation topic at highly technical places but otherwise not useful.
CSCI 1300 Interaction Design (aka UI/UX) | 15 hrs | ★★ | Scary subjective grading and had to fight tooth and nail for an A. Please S/NC if you take it with Jeff Huang.
CSCI 1515 Applied Cryptography | 4 hrs | ★ | Niche class, somewhat number theoretic, but super interesting and Peihan is an amazing professor.
CSCI 1230 Intro. to Computer Graphics | 7 hrs | ★ | Niche class that is somewhat math heavy. Many people find it very interesting though.
CSCI 1440 Algorithmic Game Theory | 7 hrs | ★ | Niche class mainly for quant recruiting. 
CSCI 0220 Discrete Structures and Probability | 3 hrs | N/A | Easy math class, interesting but in general I don't think math/theory is that useful for recruiting. Note they might rework it to be more difficult.

And here's a list of classes I didn't take and my (much less educated) opinions on them
Course number | Rumored Difficulty | Recruiting Utility | Notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
CSCI 0320 Software Engineering | Pretty time-consuming | ★★ | Possible project class & resume keyword. Most of the content is self-learnable though. Also full-stack might become less relevant nowadays due to AI.
CSCI 1440 Machine Learning | Easier than deep learning | ★★★ | Didn't take because it overlaps a bit with DL and I'm not thaaaat into AI.
CSCI 1570 Design and Analysis of Algorithms | Allegedly difficult | ★★ | Difficult algorithm class. Good conversation topic at technical places & allegedly makes you extremely good at Leetcode.
CSCI 1600 Real-time and Embedded Software | Haven't heard anything | ★ | Niche class but essential if you want to do real-time or embedded.
CSCI 1650 Software Security and Exploitation | Allegedly quite light | ★ | Niche security class about buffer overflows
CSCI 1715 Formal Proof and Verification | Allegedly not that hard | ★(★?) | Niche theory class, could be cool conversation topic at technical places.
