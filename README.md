# Timeline
- Applications for summer SWE internships/jobs start opening up on **Early May the year before**. For example, for Summer 2027 internships, you should start applying **May 2026**. **YOU SHOULD APPLY ASAP WHEN ANY APP OPENS!!** This is no longer college applications - most listings are rolling and first-come-first-serve. Apply within the first day or two gives you the best chances
- Brown internal opportunities:
  - [UTRA](https://utra.brown.edu/students#application-process) is a program where you apply to do research projects with faculty. This generally is a very nice starting point for your resume.
    - Applications for Spring semester UTRA is generally due late Sept/early Oct.
    - Applications for Summer semester UTRA is generally due late Jan/early Feb.
    - Applications for Fall semester UTRA is generally due early/mid May.
  - Outside of UTRA, don't be afraid to just approach professors and ask if they have research opportunities available! This is especially helpful if they know you from class.
  - BrownCS has a sizable undergraudate TA program that's also a nice starting point for resume. This is traditionally pretty competitive especially for intro classes, though you should apply anyways.
    - [Timeline](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/ta/hiring/). UTA applications generally open ~early Oct and you should get an email from the CS Department containing links.

# Principles
This section covers best practices to be following during job apps.
- Apply ASAP to any listing. Applications are generally rolling.
- Apply a LOT (ideally to all new listings) until your resume is good enough to not need it. The market is competitive, and people generally send out hundreds of applications.
  - For reference, my freshman summer I sent ~300 applications with 3 interviews. Sophomore summer I sent ~300 applications with 8 interviews.
- Allocate dedicated daily time over the Summer and early Fall for job apps. Apply quickly and forget - don't let it bleed all over your life.
- Check your emails frequently. Recruiters will be reaching out there.

# Resources
Every tool listed here is basically essential for the process.
- [Simplify](https://simplify.jobs/) is a browser extension that automatically fills job applications for you. Very extremely helpful for mass applying and almost universally used.
- [Jake's Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) is a LaTeX resume template that is used by almost everyone in CS. This is results-proven to be ATS (Applicant Tracking System, aka auto resume screener) friendly and LaTeX is a lot easier to manage in the long run than CareerLab/Center for Career Exploration's template, even if you have no experience in LaTeX at the moment.
- [Pitt CSC & Simplify Job Board](https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2026-Internships) is the biggest centralized CS internship job board (there's a new grad version as well). It is updated multiple times a day during application season to show the newest openings. You should be checking this daily. There are also alternative boards that you can optionally cross-reference like the [Vansh & Ouckah Board](https://github.com/vanshb03/Summer2026-Internships).
