# Brown-CS-Job-Guide
All your friends suddenly started talking about nonsensical terms and giving you anxiety? Feeling FOMO over not knowing what to prepare or where to apply? Inspired by [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/), this document will try to be a class covering everything you need to know about getting a CS internship/job while in BrownCS. The goal is to **maximize job prospects** while **minimizing stress** so you can spend you time on cooler things, such as the [Brown Touhou Club](https://discord.gg/q3YWhH26Mk), [Anime Video Game Ensemble](https://discord.gg/4MjJPBXYkz), or [Brown-RISD Game Developers](https://discord.gg/XnubdbQAua) :)

# When do I start?
From anecdotal experience, the biggest source of CS job stress by far is **procrastination and fear**. Knowing key dates will hopefully mitigate that.
- Applications for SWE internships/jobs start opening up on **Early May**. **YOU SHOULD APPLY ASAP WHEN ANY APP OPENS!!** This is no longer college applications - most listings are rolling and first-come-first-serve. Do not procrastinate.
